Step 1:
PE3 -> GPIO (Chip Select Pin)
 - defalut sate high
 
Step 2:
Connectivity SPI
Full Duplex Master

Step 3:
Generate Code

Step 4: (Write operation)
a)  Configure Control register (20h) to value 37h (0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1)
	PE3  --> RESET (CS line pulled low for start data transfer)
	-- Store Address of register and data to be written to the register in a buffer.
	SPI Transmit
	PE3  --> SET (CS line pulled high for end data transfer)
	
b)  Read the Control Register 20h whether the value is updated or not.
	PE3  --> RESET (CS line pulled low for start data transfer)
	Store Address of register in a buffer.
	SPI Transmit
	SPI Receive
	Save the output data from the register into a buffer
	PE3  --> SET (CS line pulled high for end data transfer)
	
<---------Reading the X Y Z Cordinates----------------->	
Step 5: 
	Read the X_Reg 28h - 29h for X axis data
	PE3  --> RESET (CS line pulled low for start data transfer)
	Store Address of register in a buffer.
	SPI Transmit
	SPI Receive
	Save the output of X axis data from the register into a buffer
	PE3  --> SET (CS line pulled high for end data transfer)
	
	/* X_REG = 16 BIT
	SIGNIFICANT DATA PRESENT IN THE HIGHER BYTE (8:15)
	*/
Step 6: 
	Read the Y_Reg 2Ah - 2Bh for Y axis data
	PE3  --> RESET (CS line pulled low for start data transfer)
	Store Address of register in a buffer.
	SPI Transmit
	SPI Receive
	Save the output of Y axis data from the register into a buffer
	PE3  --> SET (CS line pulled high for end data transfer)
	
Step 7: 
	Read the Z_Reg 2Ch - 2Dh for Z axis data
	PE3  --> RESET (CS line pulled low for start data transfer)
	Store Address of register in a buffer.
	SPI Transmit
	SPI Receive
	Save the output of Z axis data from the register into a buffer
	PE3  --> SET (CS line pulled high for end data transfer)
